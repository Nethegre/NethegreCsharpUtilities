#Goals for this project below

1. Create everything so that it is generic as possible
2. Follow the guidance of microsofts class library creation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/ms229042(v=vs.100) 
	a. coding conventions doc: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions
3. Allow the external codebases to fully customize every feature within the utilities without having to define config for everything 
	a. we will need to have optional config options, every option should have documented default values
	b. we don't want to have a bulky setup process for the libraries
4. Use a good net analyzers if possible: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/code-quality/install-net-analyzers?view=vs-2022
	a. maybe try to get FXCop working although it may not be supported
	b. general code analysis link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/overview#enable-additional-rules
5. Document everything with the equivalent of JAVADocs and good commenting
	a. typing "///" in front of methods etc will auto generate summaries for coding objects
		aa. need to figure out how to document exceptions properly
	b. can and should use base C# libraries as examples of how things should be documented
	c. things like resharper use these and could/should be used to see what the output will be like
5.1 Have the build process generate HTML like files that will be made avialable on the github page with proper links etc.
	a. potentially use NDoc: https://ndoc.sourceforge.net/
	b. could also use SHFB (Sand Castle): https://github.com/EWSoftware/SHFB
6. Complete the base config management libraries
7. Complete the base log management libraries
8. Complete the base resource management libraries
9. Complete the base background threading libraries
10. Migrate AYAYABot project over to using the libraries
11. Start using cancelation tokens for background threads instead of static class level booleans
12. Make all classes instantiate class level variables within default constructor so that config files are optional.
13. Make sure that every method provides debug logs of some sort
